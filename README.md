# 3D Soda Rotation Effect Using CSS

## About
This project showcases a 3D rotation effect on a soda can using pure CSS, adding an interactive and visually dynamic experience. When users hover over the can, it smoothly rotates to reveal a second image, while rock elements subtly animate in the background, enhancing the scene's depth. This demonstration is part of my 4-month roadmap to becoming a full-stack developer from scratch. Soon, I'll be sharing a detailed breakdown of how I structure my learning schedule, the resources I rely on, and the tools I use to achieve my goals.

## Features
- Pure CSS animation for 3D rotation.
- Responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.
- Includes rock images for dynamic visual effects in the background.
- Uses `mask-image` and `background-blend-mode` properties for enhanced visuals.
